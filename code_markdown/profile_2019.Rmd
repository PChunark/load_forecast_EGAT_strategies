This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
profile <- 
  read_excel("raw_data/raw_data_profiles/02_Hourly Sale_NetGen_2019.xlsx",
           sheet = "Load Curve",
           range = "C3:D17523"
            ) %>% 
  select(datetime = `Date/Time`, MEA) %>% 
  mutate(date = date(datetime),
         time = format(as.POSIXct(datetime),"%H:%M:%S"),
         year = year(datetime),
         month = month(datetime),
         day = day(datetime)) %>% 
  select(datetime, date, time, year, month, day, MEA)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
