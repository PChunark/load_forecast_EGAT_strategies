R coding techniques are included. Readers can learn how to code the R language in the format of scripts, R markdown, and bookdown. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction Electricity is one of the key final energy to drive an economy. It is used to provide enduse demands. For instance, charging electric vehicles (EVs), lighting houses, heating water and cooking, driving motors to convey products in industrial processes. In 2021, an electricity consumption was 201,986 GWh.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 2. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 2.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 2.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure!

The electricity saled to MEA (in GWh) is calculated by the summation of profile in MW divided by 2000. The reason that divided by 2000 is the profile is given a time stamp in every 30-min. There are 17520 values. Therefore, the summation of profile is divided by 2 to get the results in every 1 hr. We divided the output again by 1000 to convert the unit from MWh to GWh. # Summary data #### maxv &lt;- ceiling(max(profile$MEA)) # Get a peak MW minv &lt;- floor(min(profile$MEA)) # Get a min MW energy &lt;- sum(profile$MEA)/2000 # Calculate the energy The peak and minimum MW day are also needed to assess in order to provide the maximum and minimum a saled electricity from EGAT to MEA. peak_day &lt;- profile %&gt;% #Find a peak day group_by(year) %&gt;% filter(MEA == max(MEA)) %&gt;% pull(datetime) min_day &lt;- profile %&gt;% #Find a peak day group_by(year) %&gt;% filter(MEA == min(MEA)) %&gt;% pull(datetime) Load factor is calculated by the energy divided a maximum energy.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
