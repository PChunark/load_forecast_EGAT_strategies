R coding techniques are included. Readers can learn how to code the R language in the format of scripts, R markdown, and bookdown.

For instance, charging electric vehicles (EVs), lighting houses, heating water and cooking, driving motors to convey products in industrial processes. In 2021, an electricity consumption was 201,986 GWh.

Electricity profiles are illustrated to give an insight into profile behavior. R coding technique are given in order to understand the process flow and manage the big data obtained from several sources in the organization. 2.1 Electricity generation profiles for EGAT sale Before the project starts, library are required as follows: library(tidyverse) #For data manipulation library(readxl) #For reading the excel sheet library(scales) library(glue) library(knitr) Design a theme and lines for figures "],["parts.html", "Chapter 3 Parts", " Chapter 3 Parts You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2023) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.
